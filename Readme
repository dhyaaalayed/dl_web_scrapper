How to use:
	python load_from_web.py
		1- Generate the json files and overwrite them if they are existed
		2- Generate ansprech_partner files and overwrite them if they are existed
		3- For Montage_liste and Master_liste, Compare and add the new addresses :)

	python load_from_json.py
		1- Load the data from json
		2- Generate ansprech_partner files and overwrite them if they are existed
		3- For Montage_liste and Master_liste, Compare and add the new addresses :)


	python update_from_web.py
		1- Load the json files into classes
		2- Get the information from the web in parallel classes
		3- Update the excel files according to the new changes
		4- 


ATTENTION: If telekom changed their web elements ids, then the Navigator will not work.


______________________________
Currently:
	1- Load current stored data
	2- Update excel files of Montage liste / Master liste! and also generate new generated_ansprech_partner excel files!






Later:
	1- Load current stored data in classes
	2- Scrap new Telekom data in parallel classes
	3- Compare
	4- Take action regarding the new data:
		1- Load it to the excel files
		2- Notify our employees by sending emails :)

TODO:
	/1- Fix Navigator to get the completed address with the charachter
	/2- Fix City to get all kls, even if they have different ids
		/1- rename city_nvt_dict to nvt_list and make it list
    /3- kls class:
        /1- key must be in it not in address
            /1- Change the class
            /2- Change the navigator to modify that
            /3- And also other classes!
    /4- Address
        /Move the kls id to kls class
        /1- Add new attribute: House_char
        /2- Modify the navigator to get it
        /3- Set it empty string instead of null ig it's not existed
    5- Check out exporting json of each class/ subclass
        str function!
        city
            /nvt
                /kls
                    address
                    person
                    owner

    6- Try pickling the classes!?
        No
        Run the etl
            Just see what is the correct way to jsonify

Later:
    1- Complete the updating MontageList code
        1- Continue previous example
        2- Create updater main or a different class name!

	I created creation_time attribute to each nvt json file
	Next: I need to load the creation time before scrapping the nvt
		if the creation time occured less than 2 hours ago
			then do not scrap!

	Solving microsoft graph problem:


Left menu --> authentication

then

	Supported account types
	Who can use this application or access this API?
	Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant)

I changed it to this option

then I have got another error:
	AADSTS500113: No reply address is registered for the application.

I solved by:
Left menu --> authentication

then Add platform -> then web
then entering this redirect url: http://localhost:1234

	By adding any new Baupläne folder
		Baupläne word must be replace with this: Baupläne
			because they are not the same!
				according to microsoft graph!




23.09.2022
	TODO:
		1- Implement all todo steps in json_main
		2- Test the copying and creating new folders on graph functions




Last step: Updating and uploading montageliste for 2 nvt examples

Next step: Doing that by deleting [:1] in the city.py file

ATTENTION: Update my email signature!!!!

Ask Hakan, Goerkem about overwriting current masterliste!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Later: 
	1- Run updating telekom jsons in infinity loop
		1- Require repearing the nvt instead of stopping
			By throwing timeout exception!

	2- Put mg_json_main on another service and run it at 00:00
		Using apache airflow or just using normal script :)
